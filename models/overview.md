# Attribution playbook
This dbt project is a worked example to demonstrate how to model customer
attribution. **Check out the full write-up [here](https://blog.getdbt.com/modeling-marketing-attribution/),
as well as the repo for this project [here](https://github.com/fishtown-analytics/attribution-playbook/).**

Note that this project is not a package -- it is not intended to be installed in
your own dbt project, but instead provides a good starting point for building
similar data models for your own business.

The SQL in this project is compatible with postgres.

If you want to run this project yourself to play with it (assuming you have
dbt installed):
1. Clone [this repo](https://github.com/fishtown-analytics/attribution-playbook).
2. Create a profile named `playbook`, or update the `profile:` key in the
`dbt_project.yml` file to point to an existing profile ([docs](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/configure-your-profile)).
3. Run `dbt deps`.
4. Run `dbt seed`.
5. Run `dbt run` -- if you are using a warehouse other than Snowflake, you may
find that you have to update some SQL to be compatible with your warehouse.
6. Run `dbt test`.
-----
1. We decided to _not_ make the SQL multi-warehouse compatible since this project
is intended to be a demonstration, rather than a package. Making this project
multi-warehouse compatible would complicate the SQL.
